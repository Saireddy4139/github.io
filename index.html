									About</a></h2>
									<p>With Potent experience, I am a highly skilled Full Stack Developer adept at navigating projects through the entire software development life cycle (SDLC). My proficiency spans diverse application landscapes, including web-based, client/server, enterprise, and distributed applications, where I seamlessly integrate Java and J2EE technologies with AWS. A master in Java development, I showcase expertise from Java 8 to Java 17, incorporating advanced features like Streams and Lambdas. My front-end capabilities encompass a range of technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AJAX, JQuery, NodeJS, VueJS, Bootstrap, and various Angular versions. In the development arena, I implement MVC design patterns, particularly in Spring MVC, and specialize in crafting microservices using Spring Boot within a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). My extensive experience is evident in the design and development of multi-tiered web applications using Java & J2EE, with a focus on frameworks such as Spring MVC, Spring Boot, and Hibernate for tasks like Connection pooling, Mappings, Transaction Management, and HQL.
										Proficient in multiple Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like RAD, MyEclipse, Eclipse, and NetBeans, I ensure efficient development processes. My versatility extends to single-page application development using Angular.JS and React.JS components, alongside proficiency in developing web APIs using Node.JS. In the cloud computing domain, I navigate AWS intricacies, handling services like EC2, ELB, ECS, S3, Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFront, EFS, RDS, DMS, VPC, Route53, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, CloudFormation, and IAM. My expertise in REST and SOAP Web Services involves leveraging APIs like JAX-WS, JAXRS, JAX-B, Jersey, and Spring REST. Messaging and event-driven architectures are seamlessly integrated into projects using tools like Spring Kafka, Rabbit MQ, and Apache Kafka. XML-related technologies, SQL databases (MySQL, MS-SQL Server, Oracle SQL Server), and NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, Hbase, CosmosDB) are areas of strong proficiency. In project management, I leverage Jira for creating and managing user stories, epics, tasks, and bugs, contributing to efficient project organization and deployment. With experience in both Waterfall and Agile methodologies, including Test-Driven Development (TDD) and SCRUM, I showcase adaptability to changing priorities. As a proactive team player with exceptional analytical abilities, I am committed to performing at a high level, meeting deadlines, and swiftly mastering new concepts.</p>
